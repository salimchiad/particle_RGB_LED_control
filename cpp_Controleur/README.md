In the example code in a sequence is RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, CYAN, VIOLET, WHITE, and OFF when it's done.

Before complie the program modify it, change <YOUR_DEVICE_ID" by your device ID, and <ACCESS_GIVEN> by your given access from particle web site.

To compile it you can use "gcc -o RGB RGB.c".
